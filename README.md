This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

The application shows a clickable contact list, with search field. On searching for a name the list will change to the filtered names only. For checking the further details name from the list can be clicked.

On clearing the search field the List will be the original list and still clickable to see the details.
